     <h1>General information</h1>


     <h2> Contact </h2>

     Organisation is, like the web pages, sub-divided into
     <ul>
      <li> the "scientific level", to which this page belongs, </li>
      <li> the "local level", where the entry page is found under
       "Location, accommodation, etc.". </li>
     </ul>
     E-mail addresses are as follows:
     <ul>
      <li> for the "scientific level" (e.g., organisation of talks) please
       use <a href="mailto:sat09@swansea.ac.uk"> sat09@swansea.ac.uk </a> </li>
      <li> for the "local level" (e.g., accommodation or travel) use
       <a href="mailto:conferences@swansea.ac.uk"> conferences@swansea.ac.uk </a>
       (stating "SAT09" in the subject header). </li>
     </ul>
     If in doubt, then you may send your e-mail to both addresses.


     <h2> Posters </h2>

     <ul>
      <li> For every paper presented at the conference there can be some form
       of poster. </li>
      <li> This might be just one piece of paper, or a print-out
       of the talk, or a full-fledged poster. </li>
      <li> The <em>Seminar Room 2</em> is used for all breaks and for
       registration, and it stays open otherwise. </li>
      <li> In this room 10 poster boards are provided
       (can be used on two sides, if necessary). </li>
      <li> You are invited to put up there your poster at any time,
       starting from Monday (June 29). </li>
      <li> Those who have put up a poster are asked to be around
       for the Wednesday and the Thursday morning breaks, so that
       people can get in contact. </li>
     </ul>


     <h2> Uploading files for your talk </h2>

     <ul>
      <li> It would be good if you could upload your talks in the
       <a href="ftp://anonymous@cs-wsok.swansea.ac.uk/"> upload area </a>. </li>
      <li> Just drag-and-drop your files there, using your browser: The
       username is "anonymous", and no password is needed. </li>
      <li> The upload-directory can be listed, but the files can not
       be read. </li>
      <li> Nor can they be deleted or removed, so for new versions just
       add a version number to the filename. </li>
      <li> The connection is anonymous ftp, so of course you can
       also use a command-line tool (though since the server sits behind a
       firewall, your ftp-client must be able to handle "passive mode";
       apparently the browsers cope with that, while the command line
       tools cause more trouble). </li>
     </ul>


     <h2> Travel information </h2>
     
     Please see <a href="http://www.sat09.swan.ac.uk/location.html">
      the official travel information</a>. Below you find some
     personal recommendations.
     <ul>
      <li> <a href="http://www.bristolairport.co.uk/"> Bristol Airport </a>
       <ol>
        <li> We recommend taking the train to and from Swansea; see the
         <a href="http://www.bristolairport.co.uk/getting_to_bia/by_train.aspx">
          official airport information </a>.
        </li>
        <li> From "Bristol Temple Meads" to "Swansea", and vice versa. </li>
        <li> Booking in advance is recommended:
         <ol>
          <li> There are options for doing so. </li>
          <li> We recommend <a href="http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/">
            First Great Western </a>.
          </li>
          <li> Booking should be straight-forward; you might choose two singles
           or one return ticket. </li>
          <li> However, "Advance Single" might be risky for the direction from
           Bristol to Swansea, since the times are fixed. "Anytime Day Single"
           is appropriate (while for the other direction choosing "Advance
           Single" should be alright). </li>
          <li> For buying a return tickets, "Off-peak Return" should
           cover your case (but please check). </li>
          <li> The choice of "single" or "return" is up to you: I (OK) always
           use "Off-peak Return", since it covers my needs, and I find it
           (slightly) more convenient. Others always choose "Single" since
           in this way you can save something (though Bristol to Swansea
           is just GBP 27.50 for off-peak return). </li>
          <li> Some of the tickets (like off-peak return) can also be bought
           at the counter with no extra costs, while other tickets must be
           booked and/or can get more expensive (for peak-times). </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li> Getting to
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_University"> Swansea 
        University</a> (from Swansea):
       <ol>
        <li> Just telling a taxi driver "To the university!" should do
         the job; no need to provide further information, since the
         default landing point is <em> Fulton House </em>, and
         that's are reasonable starting point (at most 2 minutes to walk
          for all our places). </li>
        <li> To be on the safe side, instead of just "University" you
          can say "Swansea University" (that's the official name of
          this university). Actually, recently a second university
          was (re-)branded, called "Swansea Metropolitan University" now,
          and that's not where you want to go, and so to be totally
          safe you might add "not the metropolitan university". </li>
        <li> As you can see on the <a href="docs/CampusMap.pdf"> Campus map 
         </a>, Fulton House (which is number 17) is at the centre of the
         university, and everything except of the talks (<em>Faraday
            Building</em>, number 8.1 on the map) and your accommodation
          happens there.
        </li>
        <li> However when you first arrive, then you need to get the key
          at <em>Preseli Residences</em>, and from Fulton House you
          have to walk a bit (one or two minutes).
          So if you want to save this bit (because of your luggage), you might
          ask the driver directly for "Preseli Residences". </li>
        <li> Pronouncing
          "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preseli_Hills">Preseli</a>":
          A German would write it "Presselli", that is, it starts like in
          "pressure", then like in "selling", or perhaps like "Sally" (then
          you get also the ending right). </li>
        <li> All rooms are in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penmaen,_Swansea">
          Penmaen Residence </a> (number 22 on the map). As mentioned above,
          from Fulton House this is 2 minutes to walk, but you may also
          ask a taxi driver (not upon arrival, but later) to go directly to 
          Penmaen Residence (which is pronounced like "Pennm&auml;n" in
          German). </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
     </ul>


     <h2> Computer access </h2>

     <ul>
      <li> We do our best to ensure that WiFi will work for all
       kinds of laptops. </li>
      <li> To get access to WiFi and/or to get "PC access" you need to ask
       for account information when registering. </li>
      <li> Unfortunately, "PC access" is restricted to windows-machines;
       but we provide additional access to Linux machines from the
       department (during opening hours of the department): Please
       <a href="mailto:sat09@swansea.ac.uk"> contact us </a> if you want
       to have such an account (we need to create it). </li>
     </ul>


     <h2> Business meeting </h2>

     <ul>
      <li> Tuesday from 19:30 to 21:00 we have the business meeting of the
       SAT association. </li>
      <li> Every participant is invited. </li>
      <li> Participants are also 
       <a href="docs/CallforParticipationoftheSAT.pdf"> invited to join the 
        SAT association. </a> </li>
      <li> The statutes of this association are 
       <a href="docs/SATAssociation.pdf"> to be found here. </a> </li>
     </ul>


     <h2> Going out </h2>

     <ol>
      <li> We have a special meeting room for the conference in Fulton
       House, the "Castle Room". </li>
      <li> And just opposite to it we have 
       <a href="http://www.swanseaents.com/site/bars/jcs-bar"> JC's Bar, </a>
       where you might sit down, or you can take your drink with you to the
       Castle Room. </li>
      <li> This is an "easy solution", you meet your colleagues and can have
       some drinks. </li>
      <li> It will be also rather quiet: Student's won't be around at
       this time of the year (most of them left), and the only other guests
       are likely some medical engineers who have a 
       <a href="http://www.compbiomed.net/"> conference </a> which partially
       overlaps with ours. </li>
      <li> So for Monday evening things should be settled. </li>
      <li> Wednesday and Thursday evening we have the "informal" and the
       "formal banquet". </li>
      <li> After the banquet on Thursday we are close to the city centre,
       and those who want to experience a British pub can come with us
       to the <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/17/17725/No_Sign_Wine_Bar/Swansea"> No Sign Wine Bar </a> on Wind Street. </li>
       <li> This <a href="docs/SwanseaBay.pdf"> map </a> of <a 
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea"> Swansea </a> and
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_Bay"> Swansea Bay </a>
       shows the area relevant to us. 
       <ol>
        <li> Point 11 is the building opposite the Faraday Building (where all
         talks take place). </li>
        <li> At Point 2 we have our Banquet (on Thursday). </li>
        <li> And the No Sign Wine Bar just mentioned is north of Point 2. </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li> On Friday evening likely we all are a bit tired, but perhaps we
       want something different than JC's bar, and so we might book a table
       at the 
       <a href="http://www.pub-explorer.com/southwales/pub/pubonthepondswansea.htm">
        Pub On The Pond </a>, which is just at the edge of the university
        campus, perhaps 5 minutes to walk (just 100m west of Building 33
        on the above campus map). Since they want a deposit, we have
        not fixed that yet. </li>
      <li> If you are still looking for nice places to go out,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbles"> Mumbles </a> is
       the right place to go (in the south of Swansea Bay on the
       above map), with lots of restaurants at the seafront.
        <ol>
         <li> It you need just a pub, we recommend 
          <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/25/25621/White_Rose/Mumbles">
           The White Rose </a>. </li>
         <li> A nice restaurant is 
          <a href="http://www.toptable.com/en-gb/venue/?id=8253"> Adams
           Restaurant </a>, with a 3-part menu for 20 pounds. </li>
         <li> Another nice choice is
          <a href="http://www.mumbles.co.uk/Restaurants/showRestaurant.php?rID=3000009"> Mediterranean Grill </a>, which is not British (i.e., if you need
          an escape). </li>
         <li> Finally, a more expensive restaurant is
          <a href="http://www.restaurant-guide.com/patricks-restaurant.htm">
           Patricks Restaurant </a>. </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
